# routing Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change fix-header-translation-link. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: The language switcher MUST redirect to the localized version of the current page
- When a user views a page that has a localized counterpart, the language switcher in the header MUST link to that specific specific localized URL, not the home page.
#### Scenario: User switches language on a specific page
Given I am on the "/cancun-to-tulum-shuttle" page (English)
When I click the "Español" language switcher
Then I should be redirected to "/es/transporte-de-cancun-a-tulum"
And I should NOT be redirected to the Spanish home page "/es"

#### Scenario: User switches language on a non-home Spanish page
Given I am on the "/es/taxi-aeropuerto-cancun" page (Spanish)
When I click the "English" language switcher
Then I should be redirected to "/cancun-airport-taxi"
And I should NOT be redirected to the English home page "/"

### Requirement: The application MUST support a dedicated results page.
- The system MUST provide a route for displaying results, accessible in both English and Spanish.

#### Scenario: User visits the English results page
- Given a user navigates to `/results`
- Then the page should load without errors
- And the heading SHOULD be "Results"

#### Scenario: User visits the Spanish results page
- Given a user navigates to `/es/resultados`
- Then the page should load without errors
- And the heading SHOULD be "Results"

### Requirement: The system must serve the Register page at the specified localized routes.
The application routing system MUST correctly resolve the localized paths for the register page and render the appropriate content.

#### Scenario: English Route
A user navigating to `/register` sees the English version of the Register page.
#### Scenario: Spanish Route
A user navigating to `/es/registro` sees the Spanish version of the Register page.
#### Scenario: Language Injection
The router correctly passes `lang="en"` or `lang="es"` to the page component.

### Requirement: The page must include valid SEO metadata and layout.
The register page MUST follow project standards for layout and SEO by using the established components.

#### Scenario: Layout Wrapping
The page renders the global `<Layout>`.
#### Scenario: SEO Integration
The page includes `<PageSEO>` which resolves the title and description from the translation files.
